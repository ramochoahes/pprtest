              <h4>Key Understandings</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                Teachers should recognize the diversity students bring into the classroom and make sure they all feel <strong>included and equal</strong>. Again, all students should feel included and their diversity highlighted. Assignments should have diversity included in their design and not revolve around predominantly one culture or type of person. A classroom teacher should establish a classroom community. This can be done in various ways such as using icebreaker activities so students may learn about each others differences. Resolve conflicts that stem from students diversity (like gender, race, culture) differences in a way that shows people are different not better or worse. All students should be able to do the assignment, even if it means differentiating the instruction to suit special needs. Choose assignments that allow students highlight their strengths and post all students work not only that from homogeneous groups. Allow students to work with all types of students and not isolate themselves into <strong>homogeneous groups</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Special needs and ELL students should be integrated and <strong>differntiated</strong> using <strong>accommodations</strong> that make the content needed to be learned more accessible without reducing the knowledge, "watering down", content needed and without making it apparent to other students that this is being done. ELL accommodations could include integrating visuals, pairing ELL students with native speakers, hands on activities, vocabulary development, and <a href="http://moramodules.com/ALMMethods.htm" target="_blank">L2</a> acquisition strategies.
